                                It is hardly surprising that there are more things in heaven and earth, than have been dreamed of in our philosophy or in our physics. A physicist is only too happy when he finds a conflict of this kind between successful theories, it's an extraordinary opportunity. It is an opportunity to revise the hypothesis, test it, and form new conclusions; discarding the old ones.

                                This is in stark contrast to the common human tendency to form conclusions, opinions and judgements, and then rationalizing to justify them. One should follow the scientific method to form a hypothesis based on objective observations, test the hypothesis, and form a conclusion. Even this is not sufficient, one needs to revise and retest the existing hypothesis/mental models as new facts emerge and the world around us changes, instead of clinging to them.
